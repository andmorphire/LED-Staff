// A "ResetPerformance" method is provided so that the performance can be

// For demonstration purposes, this Performance is reset if the

// There are two kinds of things you can put into this performance:
// "FROM" and "AT".
//
// * "FROM" means starting FROM this time AND CALLING IT REPEATEDLY 
//   until the next "FROM" time comes.
//
// * "AT" means do this ONE TIME ONLY "AT" the designated time.
//
// At least one of the FROM clauses will ALWAYS be executed.
// In the transitional times, TWO pieces of code will be executed back to back.
// For example, if one piece says "FROM(0,0,1.000) {DrawRed()}" and another says
// "FROM(0,0,2.000) {flashblue();}", what you'll get is this:
//   00:00:01.950  -> calls DrawRed
//   00:00:01.975  -> calls DrawRed
//   00:00:02.000  -> calls DrawRed AND calls DrawBlue !
//   00:00:02.025  -> calls DrawBlue
//   00:00:02.050  -> calls DrawBlue
// In most cases, this probably isn't significant in practice, but it's important
// to note.  It could be avoided by listing the sequence steps in reverse
// chronological order, but that makes it hard to read.
